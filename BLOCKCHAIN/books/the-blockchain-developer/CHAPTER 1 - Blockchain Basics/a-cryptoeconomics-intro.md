# Section Title: Introduction to Cryptoeconomics

To understand cryptoeconomics, you first need to understand concepts such as

- encryption and decryption,
- private-public keys,
- digital assets,
- cryptography,
- cryptocurrency, and
- cryptomining

#### Cryptoeconomics

This is the combination of cryptography and economics to provide a platform to exchange digital assets.

#### Digital Asset

A digital asset can be anything of value, such as the combination to your home safe, a secret password, a list, a message, electronic cash, a document, a photo, and so on.

#### Cryptography:

This is using the techniques of encryption and decryption to send and receive messages.In fact, in the past, cryptography and encryption were synonymous.

- A cryptographic key can be used to encrypt a message.
- The encrypted message can then be decrypted only by using the second key (a private key) that is known only to the recipient.
- In a way, The messages were the “public keys” but without a way to decode them (the “private keys”), it was not enough
- In world War 2, American computer scientist invented a machine called "Bombe" that automated the process of guessing the private key to decrypt messages sent by the german "Enigma" machine

### Digital Assets + Cryptography = Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed so that electronic cash is able to be exchanged using strong cryptography

- The cryptography’s private key mechanism must be strong enough that it would be almost impossible (in other words, take too much time and effort) to figure out. Otherwise, all users could potentially lose their electronic cash if the cryptography could be figured out within a few months such as with the Enigma machine.

### Bitcoin

Although bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency invented, it’s generally considered the first successful cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamotoi with the publication of a white paper called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
The actual complete open source software was released a year later in 2009
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

Bitcoin’s success is attributed to the following characteristics:

- no one can break the public-private key,
- it’s distributed without a controlled government,
- it’s publicly available, and it’s published as open source code.

### Digital Assets + Cryptography = Cryptocurrency

Cryptoeconomics is the combination of cryptography and economics to provide a platform that gives an **incentive** to maintain the platform, its scalability, and its security;

In fact, the relation between cryptography and
cryptocurrency is indirect not just for bitcoin but for most cryptocurrency
out there.
For instance, cryptography is used in bitcoin in other ways such as the
following:
– Bitcoin uses private keys (bitcoin calls these digital
signatures) with the help of an algorithm function
(called the ECDSA elliptic curve) to prove ownership.
– Hashing algorithms are used for holding the structure
of the database ledger data (or blockchain) via a hash
generator called SHA256.
– The hashing algorithms are used to generate math
puzzles that a computer tries to solve for a prize. Once
the puzzle is solved, the computer is selected to help
handle the transactions.
Hashing algorithms are also used to generate account
addresses.
– There is the concept of Merkle trees (covered in the
next chapter), which use the hashing keys of large data
in small pieces. This is useful for lightweight wallets
that are needed on constrained hardware devices such
as mobile devices.
